		<p>Robots are increasingly becoming more common in the work place. Thet started out doing busy work so that humans could focus on more skilled professions such as teaching and doctoring. Recently, however, robots have proven themselves to be able to preform many tasks not just as good but better than humans. Driving may be our most recent advancement. Self driving cars still get into accidents but less accidents than humans because robots don't drink, get tired or behave recklessly. The video, "Humans Need Not Apply" </p>

			<h4>Yes, I agree. Very insightful Araina. Technology is advancing rapidly that many human based jobs will be taken over and replaced by AI's and robots. I also really like the color sceme that you have encorporated into the project. Other than that there isnt much done but I see the thought behind it. üëç</h4>
